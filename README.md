## The story of IDK person
It was a rainy day, like many, even most, others

It was a time with a IDK person	that start in a	darker farm at the backward of a garden.
IDK takes a light to enter a little ranch and he finds a murder.
He examined the dead body and as a coroner he tought it was a ghost that made this.

But it wasn't ! 
He was terrorised by the dead body but he saw at the edge of his vision the murderer leaving the crime scene
How did he know it was the murderer you will ask me ? Because the person leaving was running away and had a shotgun in one hand and a big bloody knife in the ohter hand
